But this semblance of peace was nothing but a sheet that concealed much repression and violation against human rights committed by the Chinese army in the east of the country led by pro-democracy separatists. since the crisis, China has not gone through the best times, the army has become incompetent indisipline see mutenie in some region instability is felt, the government is weak, the country is on the verge of collapse, constant riots rage in the country, not the choice to the Chinese leader either to accept the demands of the rebel or it is the civil war. What created the ack of peking which states that "all the teritoir of the east pass under the hands of the rebel faction united under a single flag all the time the country must be the vassal of china for as said the prime minister Chinese impose stability and lasting peace in the region."
