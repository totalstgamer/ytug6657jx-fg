 prcintroducing.1.d:0 "China is the historic rival of the United States since the beginning of the downfall, thanks to its unprecedented economic power, allowing it to steal the title of the world's leading power after the visible, predictable and irrefutable decline of the American colossus. But this semblance of peace was nothing but a cover up for the repression and violation of human rights committed by the Chinese army in the Western provinces of the country which was controlled by pro-democracy separatists. Since the crisis, China has not gone through its best times. The army has become incompetent and undisciplined, suffering from constant mutiny. Instability is felt everywhere, the government is weak, the country is on the verge of collapse and riots are happening all across the country. The Chinese leader had a choice to either accept the demands of the rebels or go into a civil war. This led to the signing of the treaty of Peking which states that "All of the territory in the west is under control of the rebel faction united under a puppet goverment of the PRC." The prime minister of China stated that he hoped that the treaty would bring stability and lasting peace to the region. But has this solved the issue? With rebels becoming more and more autonomous, the conflict in China seems all but solved."

 rusintroducinge.1.d:0 "Russia, the largest country in the world and one of the world's superpowers, experienced an incredible economic boom in the 21st century, never before seen since the collapse of the Soviet Union, due to almost inexhaustible oil reserves being discovered in Siberia after the ice in the region melted. Because of this, Russia has now established itself as a superpower. "The oil is like a weapon with which we can increase the strength of a great nation" said the CEO of GAZPROM. But the great crisis does not forgive anyone. Due to massive inflation and unemployment, revolts happen all across the country. This has caused the rise of extremist groups which the army wants to contain, but how can it contain 300M people? In the words of General Karbinski "The government panic and lack of a permanent solution has forced us to make a costly decision, that is to create a puppet in the far reaches of Siberia to send all rebels and those who support them." And this has worked for now, but is this a good decision for the country in the long term?"
